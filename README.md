# CHATGPT REVIEWS EDA 

ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered context at each conversation stage. ChatGPT is an extraordinary tool for working more efficiently, and that doesnâ€™t stop with data analytics. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is understood as the process of performing the initial phases of data analysis. With the EDA, data scientists aim to have a complete picture of the data, analyze the patterns, and find the possible factors for anomalies. These operations are highly important in the emerging field of business intelligence (BI).
EDA includes three important steps, namely:

* Data visualization: This aspect of EDA involves converting raw data into visual information in the form of charts, maps, and graphs.

* Hypothesis testing: It is used to analyze if there is a statistically significant difference between two or more groups. This can be used to support or disprove data-related theories.

* Summary statistics: It includes computing fundamental statistics like the mean, median, and standard deviation. Summary statistics helps in understanding the distribution of data and spotting any outliers.

ChatGPT can be used as a valuable tool for EDA as it can simplify the process. You can the AI-based chatbot for a wide range of EDA tasks. Let's explore ChatGPT for Exploratory Data Analysis in the following sections.
